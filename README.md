# Lip-to-speech-synthesis
 
 ## Description
 
 The Lip to Speech project is an application of Python 3 that utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to convert lip movements into audible speech.

 ## Key Components and Features

1. **Data Collection:** Gather videos of people speaking and their transcripts.
2. **Preprocessing:** Extract frames from videos, match them with audio for training data.
3. **Facial Landmark Detection:** Use computer vision to find facial features like lips and jaw.
4. **Speech Recognition:** Convert audio to text transcripts.
5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis:** Create speech from text using TTS models.
6. **Lip Syncing:** Make lip movements match speech by mapping sounds to mouth movements.
7. **Integration and Deployment:** Combine everything into a system, make it efficient and scalable, and use it for different purposes.
8. **Evaluation and Testing:** Test the system's accuracy, speech clarity, and how natural it sounds, also get feedback from users.
9. **Documentation and Support:** Provide guides and help resources for users and developers.

Overall, this project combines advancements in machine learning, computer vision, and speech processing to address the challenging problem of lip sync to speech synthesis, opening up new possibilities for multimedia content creation and human-computer interaction.
